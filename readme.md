\\  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
- In statically typed programming languages, type checking occurs at compile time. At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known. Examples of programming languages that fall here are: Java, C++, C#, C, Pascal,etc.
- In dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript,PHP, Ruby.etc.

\\ Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined.
- Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. undefined is a type by itself (undefined). Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.
- e.g let n;
- console.log(n); i.e is undefined
- While, null is an object. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
- e.g let n = null; 
- javaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.
- n = array.slice(0, 2);
- i.e the variable n is given an initial value of null. Later, the value of the variable has been calculated from an expression.
